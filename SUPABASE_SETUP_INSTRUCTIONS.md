# Complete Supabase Setup Instructions

## ✅ What I've Done

1. **Fixed Supabase Configuration**: Updated `/lib/supabase.ts` to properly initialize with your credentials
2. **Created Database Schema**: Generated `supabase-setup.sql` with all required tables and policies
3. **Updated Authentication**: Fixed the auth context to work properly with Supabase
4. **Environment Variables**: Your `.env` file is already configured correctly

## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Create Database Tables
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://zfwlrskjtwabynglrmgz.supabase.co
2. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Copy the entire content from the `supabase-setup.sql` file I created
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute all commands

### Step 2: Test Your App
1. Restart your development server (stop and start again)
2. Try to register a new user using the Sign Up screen
3. Try to sign in with the new user credentials

## 📋 Database Tables Created

The SQL script will create these tables:
- **profiles** - User profile information
- **kids** - Children information for parents
- **payments** - Payment tracking
- **communications** - Messages between parents and admin
- **media_uploads** - Pic of the week feature

## 🔧 Features Enabled

- ✅ User registration and authentication
- ✅ Automatic profile creation via database trigger
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Parent and Admin role management
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the console logs** - The app logs detailed information about Supabase operations
2. **Verify database setup** - Make sure all SQL commands ran successfully
3. **Check Supabase dashboard** - Look at the Authentication and Database sections
4. **Restart the app** - Sometimes a fresh restart helps

## 🎯 Next Steps

After completing the database setup, you can:
1. Create your first admin user by signing up and then manually changing the role to 'admin' in the Supabase dashboard
2. Test all the app features (dashboard, kids management, payments, etc.)
3. Customize the app further based on your needs
